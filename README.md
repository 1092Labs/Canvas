# Canvas
An open source experiment to radically reinvent how we work together - anytime, anywhere

# Why now?
1. Talent is everywhere, opportunity is not
2. The rise of remote work demands a new way for the knowledge worker to engage & drive shared learning in a hybrid organization
3. Distributed work should empower & cultivate the wisdom of the crowd - which requires decentralization, diversity, & independence.

# Principles
1. Autonomy
2. Mastery
3. Purpose

# How might we be able to do this, together?
1. You are invited to contribute ideas & improvements to this collective effort. Doing so in public requires you to adapt vulnerability (the willingness to be comfortable with not knowing) & intellectual humility (the willingness to change your mind when a better approach comes along)
2. Your perspective, however unique, has value & merit - don't let anyone else convince you otherwise.
3. Always remember: you will never know what it's like to know something you don't know; just as you'll never know what it's like to not know something you already know.


# What's the plan?
1. Expand the realm of possibilities - We are going to perform market research, define principles, & articulate a shared vision
2. ??? (PRs welcome)
3. Change the world? Yep.
4. Profit? Nah.

# Navigating this project
There are a number of topics we'll be diving deep into. Check out the markdown files in this repository to explore our thinking.
1. Shared learning
