# Canvas
An open source experiment to radically reinvent how we work together - anytime, anywhere

# Why now?
1. Talent is everywhere, opportunity is not
2. The rise of remote work demands a new way for the knowledge worker to engage & drive shared learning in a hybrid organization
3. Distributed work should empower & cultivate the wisdom of the crowd - which requires decentralization, diversity, & independence.

# Principles
1. Autonomy
2. Mastery
3. Purpose

# How might we be able to do this, together?
1. You are invited to contribute ideas & improvements to this collective effort. Doing so in public requires you to adapt vulnerability (the willingness to be comfortable with not knowing) & intellectual humility (the willingness to change your mind when a better approach comes along)
2. Your perspective, however unique, has value & merit - don't let anyone else convince you otherwise.
3. Always remember: you will never know what it's like to know something you don't know; just as you'll never know what it's like to not know something you already know.


# What's the plan?
1. Expand the realm of possibilities - We are going to perform market research
2. ??? (PRs welcome)
3. Change the world? Yep.
4. Profit? Nah.


You can copy, change, or share any of these ideas in any way you choose.
