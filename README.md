# Canvas
An open source experiment to radically reinvent how we work together - anytime, anywhere

# Why now?
1. Talent is everywhere, opportunity is not
2. The rise of remote work demands a new way for the knowledge worker to engage & drive shared learning in a hybrid organization
3. Distributed work should empower & cultivate the wisdom of the crowd - which requires decentralization, diversity, & independence.

# Principles
1. Autonomy
2. Mastery
3. Purpose

# How?
