# Intro
One of the greatest phenomena you’re likely to encounter in your life is human kindness. Frankly, it doesn’t make sense and it certainly defies common misconceptions we have about the beings that roam around us, in the streets & in the fiber cables. Having recently been the recipient of said blessing, the question: “why don’t people ask for help more often?” arose and inspired this very essay.

# What would happen if we doubled the rate of requests we make to the fellow members of our organization?
Given the transformational osmosis that occurs during shared learning, it’s a mystery why it doesn’t happen more often. Majority of institutional knowledge, nuance insight, & organizational social mapping is acquired in a linear rate with random spikes of accelerated growth of wisdom from the casual conversation drops and 1:1 bonding / venting time. Why haven’t we engineered social spaces for the members of our organizations to ask their most embarrassing questions or seek help to unblock or unlock work otherwise left to brute-force of time & Confluence?

# Could anonymity mask our fears & help us uncover organizational & intellectual secretes?
1. Could the magic internet points model of Reddit/Quora/HN be gamification to encourage organizational knowledge sharing?
2. Could members of an organization self-govern a forum to debate & dialogue without raising the hairs of HR & corporate lawyers?
3. Could leaders combat their fears of a hostile employee takeover if they relinquish control of content & self-gathering tools?
4. Could the quite voices in the Zoom call dash to the front pages with insight & wisdom?
5. Could this be an opportunity to embody aspects of holocracy within organizations without destroying the hierarchical order that provides middle management job safety?

In all seriousness, there is fundamental value in creating space & time for human kindness to flourish. 1:1 or 1:many tools like Slack & Zoom lead us to harbor feelings of judgment, shame, fright, & timidness. For our organizations to sprout their full knowledge tree, we must built a tree house for us to safely share moments of kindness & vulnerability or else we’ll be climbing the fruits of wisdom without the staircase of the human collective. Stay hungry, stay vulnerable.
