# Intro
There's nothing more embarrassing to an organization than its blindness to the talents, skills, & ambition of its own people. After all, as Steve Jobs once said, you don't hire bright folks to tell them what to do; you hire them to tell you what to do. For an organization to succeed in leveraging its people, it must make intentional effort to understand them & ensure that they are understood by their peers. There's nothing more insulting to the knowledge worker than wasted time & potential.

# The importance of understanding your people
The business, mission, & strategic value of this investment is clear & the effort is truly worthwhile.

1. Staffing teams with the right people, at the right time, & on the right project
2. Efficient & effective on-boarding for new members through effective matching with mentors, coaches, & guides
3. Improvements in hiring conversion rate as a result of effectively selecting interviewers that closely match the background & interests of the candidate
4. Improvements in employee retention through effective creation, recommendations, & engagement of employee support & interest groups based on more genuine & meaningful profiles created & shared
