# Intro
There exists a driver on linux called "Video for Linux" that allows you to manage all of the buffers that are fed into the video call you're having on Zoom or Meet. The cool tick is that the kernel module would mimick that of a linux video driver and allow you to feed a video buffer (each frame and its pixels) into what ever client is injesting the pixels for a two-way call.
This simply means that we can have cool-slide-video.mp4 be a "camera" driver and agnositc of any client, we'll be able to feed in custom content.

- Documentation for V4L (Video for Linux) https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/v4.12/media/kapi/v4l2-core.html
- There is also a Python CV2 implementation for building a dynamic green screen on any video call by taking in a real video driver feed and overlaying it above a custom video buffer. Check it out here: https://elder.dev/posts/open-source-virtual-background/ William did warn that using Payton’s CV2 would likely tank FPS all the way down to 10 even — beware!

Shoutout to William Wold (https://github.com/wmww) for the recommendation & thourough walkthrough of how this comes together

Demo coming soon (Valve Time)

# What's possible?
1. A video conference member having a live feed of a certain site with live changes from participation
2. Opportunity to create the next generation of conversation interfaces & chat-bots using a video screen as opposed to a chat box
3. On-demand access to a digital assistant who can log basic input (hand gestures, voice, chat feed) and change the video buffer as a result w/ backend logic feeding directly into a video feed
4. A new way for product instructions & guides are consumed. What if you called for dynamic product help?
5. Real-time voting & shared jamboard "screencast" for the classroom where a video call assistant becomes the teacher's favorite helper
6. Language development & body/facial change analysis service to create unique feedback loops based on real-time changes just like a video call to your mentor or trusted friend
7. Collaborative watch-parties that are interactive & responsive for group voting based participation w/ ability to elicit private info from each member of the call
8. Automated breakout group session coordination, managment, and tracking so the host can apply simple rule changes to the conference call to dynamically allocate, match, & distribute call participation
9. Your 1st call won't be for a phone screen but maybe a video call w/ a digital assistant programmed to test you & capture responses contextually
10. Search tool for organizational knowledge sorting through all of the calls indexed within the company
11. Everyone's personal meeting co-pilot that can capture, reference, & aggregate insights and information custom to your needs

Much like stories or news feed, this will be a new type of media creation & consumption format that will likely see adoptation in 1:1, 1:many, & many:many communication tools. The video player may just be the next computing device. Do you see a box or do you see opportunity?

How might we be able to apply the simple SCAMPER framework to invision new interaction experiences?
1. How might we be able to substitute the video player with something that exceeds our expectation?
2. How might we combine the video player w/ another element or experience to enhance or improve an interaction?
3. How might we amplify it the  video player so we can feel, see, hear, & do more?
4. How might we be able to polarize the video box so the extreme effects can expose a different need or use case?
5. How might we be able to eliminate something from, about, with the video player without breaking it completely?
6. How might we be able to reverse a process or method so the video player can serve unique roles, actions, & inputs?
7. What secret about a video player, if known, would lead you and others to treat it differently?

Scratch.
Feeze frame.
