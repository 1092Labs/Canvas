# Intro: Converstion layer of us, the organization
There exist a lot of conversation layers on the internet. The most popular one is for the public conversation, operated by Twitter. This project aims to create the conversation layer of us, the organization of people that want to better listen, understand, & serve the customer.

# Listening
1. How might we be able to have a continous conversation with our customers so we can act on the most relevant need?

# Understanding
1. How might we be able to map the needs of our customers to the services or products we offer?
2. How might we be able to evaluate the features of the product or service we offer to map their releative strength in increasing customer satisfaction?

# Serving
Once we've listened and understood our customers, how might we be able to align on a strategy that can allow us to focus our resources, time, & energy on the few things that matter most to our customers?

For us to effectively serve our customers, we need to speak the same language about our customers & their needs. The Kano Model allows us to crate a functionality-to-performance mapping & score for each of the features that our product or service offers. 
1. Must be: Increase in performance for this feature will get us to baseline customer satisfaction
2. One-dimensional: Increase in performance for this feature yields linear increase in satisfaction
3. Delighters: Customers may not be vocal about these features because it may not be top of mind. However, any increase in performance this feature yields high customer satisfaction and ultimately creates excitment.

# How might we be able to anchor our conversations on what matters to the customer?
