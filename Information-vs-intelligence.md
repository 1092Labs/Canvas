# Intro
Understanding the clear distinction between information & intelligence can provide clarity for the knowledge worker in their search for purpose in their efforts towards solving a problem.

In a world where information is in abundance, value is best extracted by those who can ask the right questions, at the right time, to best identify signal from noise. The best teammates are those that provide intelligence to their partners & stakeholders - saving their team time & energy by front-loading the analysis themselves. Everyone on the team has to trust that the intelligence they receive from their partners is contextual, actionable, & timely.

# Information > Analysis > Intelligence
Information alone isn't valuable; it needs to be analyzed - to eventually become intelligence.

# Intelligence analysis is a form of decision making
The best definition for intelligence analysis is "the continual process of forming judgments (making decisions) based on available information while leaving with inherent uncertainty."

Understanding the gravity of the judgments and decisions made in gathering, analyzing, and contextualizing information can empower the knowledge worker with belief  that their stakeholders can only make the best decisions if they make the best decisions in their intelligence analysis.

# Knowledge problems stemming from information
Knowledge problems are those we do not have the knowledge to understand, even though the information to formulate this knowledge may already be readily available. This further clarifies the distinction between information & intelligence.
