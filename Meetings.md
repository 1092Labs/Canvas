# Intro
It’s important to consider the entire lifecycle for decisions. As Edward De Bono says — the pitfalls of analysis stem for one’s desire to zoom to the end without considering the value of each step in the path. Macro-decisions are an aggregate of the micro decisions that create momentum; define the perception & perspective we hold; and guide the flow of information for the collective decision making body. It’s important to track, measure, & review the micro-decisions on our journey to making the macro-decisions. Doing so will light the path with clarity and purpose while providing the much needed assurance of finality at each milestone.

# Path: Micro-decisions
1. Before the meeting
2. During the meeting
3. After the meeting

# Before the meeting
1. How might we be able to build a shared understanding of the problem we're solving or the decision we're making?
2. How might we be able to ensure that we have a proper DACIN model in place: Driver, Approver, Consultant, Informed, & Next Steps. This creates shared alignment on the "who".
3. How might we be able to create shared alignment on the objective of the meeting so we can anchor discussions that can ground our use of time & energy
4. How might we be able to elicit privately held information from participants so we can surface the hidden requirements from various stakeholders.

# During the meeting
1. How might we be able to leverage a shared dictionary so everyone can speak the same language on the specifics of our problem?
2. How might we be able to empower the inner voice of the collective so we don't miss out on valuable information that gets drowned by bureaucracy or rank

# After the meeting
1. How might we be able to ensure the accurate, timely, & succinct representation of the meeting that is easily accessible to participants & easily shareable to extended stakeholders
2. How might we be able to create continuity into the next meeting with the goal of building on our shared understanding, micro-decisions, & crowdsourced requirements
