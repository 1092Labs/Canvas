# Intro
The most effective organization is one that emraces the ethos of an always-on shared learning. The best talent is one that you cultivate, not hire.

# Principle
Often times, the best answer is just a better question. For our collective efforts to yield creative solutions, we must remain grounded in curiosity.

# What is shared learning?
Shared learning is an organization's ability to timely elicit, contextually document, & broadly socialize the hidden talents, knowledge, & inspirations of its people. Shared learning embraces the bottoms-up approach to collective cultural change that doesn't rely on laptop stickers, empty quotes, & soulless mantras - just the wisdom of the crowd.

# What does an always-on approach entail?
The need to have shared learning be always-on stems from the reality that organizations are constantly hiring, promoting, and firing & the nature of highly competitive labor market increases flight risk for the best talent. For an organization to retain & attract the best talent, it must ensure that knowledge isn't lost when folks leave and that new folks can leverage the momentum the organization has already heavily invested in.

# Timely eliciting
It's much more valuable to get a mediocre solution when you need it than to get the best solution when you don't. We must be vigilant about understanding the value that each and every member of our organization possesses so we can quickly, efficiently, & reliably tap into their talents in a repeatable manner.

# Contextually documenting
Information is usefulness without proper context of use case, revision history, & source. The most effective work a knowledge worker can produce is one that is easiest for another to add on to. 

# Broadly socializing
Any organization that relies on water coolers to socialize knowledge has failed its mission, people, & customers. We must be conscious about the rise of a distributed & diverse workforce; the difficulties of communicating without a shared dictionary; and the pitfalls of the human race - forgetting things.

For an organization to make shared knowledge effective, it must intentionally create space for it or empower its people to self-gather & self-direct around impactful problems.
